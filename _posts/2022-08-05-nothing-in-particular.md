## This is just a random post using the build in github editor..

I just found out that pressing "." when you are in a repository in Github will open the Visual Studio Code editor using your current repository for editing.

I'm using it to write this post right now, since I'm curious as to what will happen once I publish it without running jekyll directly.

I guess I will find out. :)
