## Finally fixed the templates and updates pages...

Wow, it has been a few years since I messed with this site and Jekyll.  For the longest time it just sat here, kinda broken.

Well, today I finally invested the time and effort into fixing it.  The headers were kinda messed up so the pages didn't reder properly.  That has been fixed.

I will probably start publishing random things here again now that I have the templating engine fixed.
