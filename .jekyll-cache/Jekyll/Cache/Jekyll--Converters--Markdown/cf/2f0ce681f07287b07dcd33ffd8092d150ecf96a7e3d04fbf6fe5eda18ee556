<p>Main site:  <a href="https://allstarlink.org">AllStarLink Network</a></p>

<p>I initially did most of the work on this back in October/November 2015.  At the time, I had quite a bit of free time
on my hands, as I was retiring from the US Navy after 20 years of active duty service and looking for a new job.</p>

<p>After my initial push to get most of the stuff converted, and there are still a few modules that need to be ported over, 
ended up stopping for abit with the eventual plan to pick this back up.  I finally decided to release this on Github so that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The code doesn’t get lost in time.</li>
  <li>I hope that I can start collaborating with others on this.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d really like to see the AllStarLink network move forward, and think that Jim Dixon (et all) have done a really great job on 
getting it up and keeping it running.</p>

<p>With any project, if things stagnate (regardless of how great they work), then there is a possibility that it will eventually
die off.  I’d like to see AllStarLink eventually move from 1.4 to 1.8 and then onto a more recent and supported version of Asterisk
like 13.</p>
